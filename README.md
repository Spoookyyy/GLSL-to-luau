# GLUU - GLSL to LUAU Converter ðŸš€

Pronounced just like "glue", GLUU is a tool designed to convert GLSL shaders to LUAU. GLUU makes the integration process, making it easy to bring shaders to roblox
## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Automatic Importing**: All functions are imported at the beginning of the converted code
Some Godot Shaders may not work with GLUU [Godot Shaders](https://godotshaders.com/shader-type/canvas_item)
